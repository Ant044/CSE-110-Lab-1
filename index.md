Hello! My name is Andrew, and I was born and raised in Northern California. I became interested in coding because my father worked as a software developer.
I started by messing around in `Ruby` in middle school. I never got that far with that, but I did end up going down that route in high school and college.
I took some courses in `c++` and `Java`, and I'm excited to learn *more*!

### Random Snippet of Code:
